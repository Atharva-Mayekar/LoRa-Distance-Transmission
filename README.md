# LoRa-Distance-Transmission
LoRa-powered ultrasonic distance sensing with ESP8266 â€” tested up to 600m with visual connection feedback

A practical project exploring long-range wireless communication using LoRa SX1278 (433 MHz) modules paired with a waterproof ultrasonic sensor and ESP8266 boards.

ðŸ“¦ Project Overview
This project demonstrates transmitting real-time distance data from an ultrasonic sensor over LoRa, monitoring the range and reliability under real-world conditions.

Bonus:
An LED indicator on the receiver side acts as a visual connection status indicator â€” it stays ON as long as valid packets are received.
